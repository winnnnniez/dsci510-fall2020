URL for website or API: https://nookazon.com/products/villagers

Brief description of data/API (what it contains, what it represents, etc.):
  The url link to the villager section of Nookazon, a website that allow Animal Crossing: New Horizons players to trade the items in the game.
  The website contains 391 villagers' image, name and average price. The price is measured by bells (the currency in the game).
  The average price is calculated by taking the median of prices from the listing of that item (i.e. villager).
  For some of the villagers don't have valid price (either no record or it's not sell for bells), the default price is 1,000,000 bells.
